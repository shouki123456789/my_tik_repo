Implementation of an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using Minimax.

## Minimax Algorithm

Minimax algorithm is a decision-making strategy used in two-player games, like Tic-Tac-Toe or chess. Its goal is to find the best move for a player, assuming that the opponent also makes optimal moves. The algorithm explores all possible moves, creating a tree of possible game states, and assigns a score to each state. It then selects the move that leads to the maximum score for the player or the minimum score for the opponent, alternating between maximizing and minimizing at each level of the tree. The idea is to anticipate and choose moves that maximize the player's chances of winning while considering the opponent's optimal responses.
